use conventional commit, feat, fix, chore, test, docs, refactor, perf, style, ci, build, revert

main point in the main message, keep it short, the code changes always have precedence over other changes like style or documentation,
the main commit message has to always be about the changes to the code wich affects real functionality, NOT docs, or AI guidelines, or other non-code changes

if meaningful, highlight the most impactful changes in the commit body or explain why the change was made, if not obvious
other changes like style, guidelines, refactors can be in the commit body

always use lowercase for everything besides abbreviation like API, UI, or names like Angular, RxJS, etc.
